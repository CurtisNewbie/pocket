Terminal-Based Password Protected Notebook App that is powered by tview and sqlite3, simple but useful. It's designed to be based on vim's classic key bindings (e.g., `hjkl` to move arounds). For some usages, it will awake vim to actually edit the content, so it won't work for all platforms (i.e., it may only work on linux, macos or other linux-liked os).

When creating or editing note, use `h`/`j` or arrow keys to select the input field, and press enter to edit content in vim editor.
